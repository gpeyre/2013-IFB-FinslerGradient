\section*{Conclusion}

This paper has presented a novel way to encode piecewise regular constraints for curve evolutions. This is achieved by designing Finsler penalties in the tangent space of curves. This method offers a unifying treatment of this class of evolutions. A distinctive feature of this approach is that it uses a convex modeling of the geometric constraints. For the particular case of piecewise rigid and piecewise similarity transforms, this avoids the need to specify	the location of the articular points, which is a difficult problem. Instead, these articulations are obtained, at each iteration, through the resolution of a convex program. This novel method opens the doors to many fascinating theoretical questions, such as the definition of a continous flow when letting $\tau_k \rightarrow 0$, and the properties of Finslerian spaces of curves.
